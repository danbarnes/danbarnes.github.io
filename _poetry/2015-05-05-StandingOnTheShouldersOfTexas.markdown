<b>Standing On The Shoulders Of Texas</b>

I been thumbing my way across Texas
but today is for thinking.
Midland traffic ain’t picking up hitchers,
not the duffel bag kind.
I’ve lightened my load with each day on the road,
but some things just won't leave my  mind.

  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  I can see Baghdad.
  I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,
  whose families are crying.
  I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,
  flesh and bone.
  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  far from alone.

My baby sister is waiting in Dallas
with a sofa to camp on.
We're gonna drive to that old church in Marshall,
where Mom and Dad lie.
Dad never spoke of the jungles he fought in,
now I understand why.

  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  I can see Baghdad.
  I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,
  whose families are crying.
  I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,
  flesh and bone.
  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  far from alone.

    Two days ago, I rode with an old Navy chaplain.    
    He said, Iraq or Korea, you carry on the same.
    You’re breathing life into the memory of the fallen.
    Standing in their sea of white stones,
    saluting their names.

  Well, it’s a start on a reason to be safe,
  flesh and bone.
  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  standing on the shoulders of Texas.
  Standing on the shoulders of Texas,
  far from alone.
