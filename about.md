I'm musical, verbal, visual and technical. Jack of all trades! Currently giving my creative side room to run. Doing genealogy, too -- it's like a jigsaw puzzle wrapped in a crossword.

In [Minnesota's largest newsroom](https://startribune.com), 1998-2021, I was content management system administrator for print and a 24x7 tech advisor and troubleshooter for all kinds of newsgathering and print publishing tools and problems. I did a lot of translating back and forth between journalese and IT-ish. I was a mechanic, a teacher, a builder, a herder of cats.

I was one of America's very first digital news editors, on the Star Tribune's "TriStar Videonews" project of *1981*. I published news stories to Compuserve, a dial-up, non-graphical national community whose subscribers could pay $5/hour to read content from the Minneapolis Tribune and Minneapolis Star, as well as the Washington Post, the New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and other papers. WAYYY pre-internet.

For historical interest, here's my [Minneapolis Star Tribune staff bio page] (https://www.startribune.com/dan-barnes/6370528), still published at startribune.com as of November 2022. I couldn't be prouder to have worked for that terrific organization in publishing 10,000+ issues. And with so many talented and dedicated colleagues to have seen the Strib through generations of tech advances.
