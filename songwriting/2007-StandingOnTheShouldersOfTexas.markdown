title: Standing On The Shoulders Of Texas
---

<i>By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse</i><br>

I been thumbing my way across Texas<br>
but today is for thinking.<br>
Midland traffic ain’t picking up hitchers,<br>
not the duffel bag kind.<br>
I’ve lightened my load with each day on the road,<br>
but some things just won't leave my  mind.<br>

Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
I can see Baghdad.<br>
I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,<br>
whose families are crying.<br>
I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>

My baby sister is waiting in Dallas<br>
with a sofa to camp on.<br>
We're gonna drive to that old church in Marshall<br>
where Mom and Dad lie.<br>
Dad never spoke of the jungles he fought in,<br>
now I understand why.<br>

Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
I can see Baghdad.<br>
I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,<br>
whose families are crying.<br>
I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>

Two days ago, I rode with an old Navy chaplain.<br>  
He said, Iraq or Korea, you carry on the same.<br>
You’re breathing life into the memory of the fallen,<br>
standing in their sea of white stones,<br>
saluting their names.<br>

Well, it’s a start on a reason to be safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
standing on the shoulders of Texas.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>
