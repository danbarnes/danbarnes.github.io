title: That New Guy
---

By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse<br>

That new guy blows in out of nowhere,<br>
in an old red Dodge -- heck, it's older than him.<br>
He's lookin' for honest work, headin' for Houston.<br>
Comin' through here had to be on a whim.<br>
He charms every waitress, between his odd jobs.<br>
Some, they try to be his Yellow Rose.<br>
But soon, folks are talkin'. Where'd he come from? Who's he seeing?<br>
And whose heart will bruise when he goes?<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>

That new guy never crashed his new Mustang,<br>
never lost his true love in the passenger seat.<br>
No, those scars that he's wearing are all from the Army<br>
or a demon of a mare, threw him deep in mesquite.<br>
He struggles each day to keep up his guard<br>
and his heart behind that friendly wall.<br>
He jokes and he grins, but it's hokum and it's bluster.<br>
No waitress ever knows him at all.<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>

Tonight the Dodge will take him down a dozen dusty roads.<br>
At every lonely intersection,<br>
he'll flip a coin which way to go.<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>
