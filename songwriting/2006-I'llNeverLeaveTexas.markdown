title: I'll Never Leave Texas
---

<i>By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse</i><br>

I can leave half a beer on the table,<br>
I can leave my dreams unfulfilled.<br>
I can leave Lubbock for Austin<br>
with a few good hours left unkilled.<br>
I can leave behind honeys who'd kiss me,<br>
I can leave behind money I'm owed.<br>
I can leave my mind free to wander<br>
but Texas has my heart lassoed.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

You can take your French vacations.<br>
You can take your New York trends.<br>
You can take this song to Nashville<br>
but that's not my style, my friend.<br>
You can take me for some kind of no-good.<br>
You can take me to task for my ways.<br>
You can take this state for granted<br>
but this Texan’s still amazed.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

When I die, you can help me<br>
make sure I stay at home.<br>
Give my ashes to the west wind<br>
blowing down that Texas road.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>
