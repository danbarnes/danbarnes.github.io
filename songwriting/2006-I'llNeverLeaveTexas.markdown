I’ll Never Leave Texas
By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse

I can leave half a beer on the table,<p>
I can leave my dreams unfulfilled.<p>
I can leave Lubbock for Austin<p>
with a few good hours left unkilled.<p>
I can leave behind honeys who'd kiss me,<p>
I can leave behind money I'm owed.<p>
I can leave my mind free to wander<p>
but Texas has my heart lassoed.<p>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

You can take your French vacations.
You can take your New York trends.
You can take this song to Nashville
but that's not my style, my friend.
You can take me for some kind of no-good.
You can take me to task for my ways.
You can take this state for granted
but this Texan’s still amazed.

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.
My mind loves the state it’s in--
lone star free to roam.
Fort Worth to Alamo,
Beaumont to San Antone,
call me loco but I know what I know,
I'll never leave Texas!

When I die, you can help me
make sure I stay at home.
Give my ashes to the west wind
blowing down that Texas road.

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.
My mind loves the state it’s in--
lone star free to roam.
Fort Worth to Alamo,
Beaumont to San Antone,
call me loco but I know what I know,
I'll never leave Texas!
