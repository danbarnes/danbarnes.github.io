In the late Oughts, I spent four years on a new hobby: Writing country songs. I've always been a writer who loved short, short fiction, and country is the last lyric-driven pop music genre, so when I stumbled onto a songwriting workshop faculty show one night in Nashville, I was hooked. But I'd always been a jazz fan, so it was a corner turn to think country! Here are lyrics to a Texas song trilogy that I wrote with my friend, Brad Dunse, who lived in Texas for a while. I'll get some of Brad's swell recordings linked here eventually. These lyrics are copyright 2007, Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse. <br>

Standing On The Shoulders Of Texas<br>
By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse<br>

I been thumbing my way across Texas<br>
but today is for thinking.<br>
Midland traffic ain’t picking up hitchers,<br>
not the duffel bag kind.<br>
I’ve lightened my load with each day on the road,<br>
but some things just won't leave my  mind.<br>

Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
I can see Baghdad.<br>
I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,<br>
whose families are crying.<br>
I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>

My baby sister is waiting in Dallas<br>
with a sofa to camp on.<br>
We're gonna drive to that old church in Marshall<br>
where Mom and Dad lie.<br>
Dad never spoke of the jungles he fought in,<br>
now I understand why.<br>

Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
I can see Baghdad.<br>
I can see buddies who weren't so lucky,<br>
whose families are crying.<br>
I can’t see  the reason that I’m safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>

Two days ago, I rode with an old Navy chaplain.<br>  
He said, Iraq or Korea, you carry on the same.<br>
You’re breathing life into the memory of the fallen,<br>
standing in their sea of white stones,<br>
saluting their names.<br>

Well, it’s a start on a reason to be safe,<br>
flesh and bone.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
standing on the shoulders of Texas.<br>
Standing on the shoulders of Texas,<br>
far from alone.<br>

I'll Never Leave Texas<br>
By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse<br>

I can leave half a beer on the table,<br>
I can leave my dreams unfulfilled.<br>
I can leave Lubbock for Austin<br>
with a few good hours left unkilled.<br>
I can leave behind honeys who'd kiss me,<br>
I can leave behind money I'm owed.<br>
I can leave my mind free to wander<br>
but Texas has my heart lassoed.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

You can take your French vacations.<br>
You can take your New York trends.<br>
You can take this song to Nashville<br>
but that's not my style, my friend.<br>
You can take me for some kind of no-good.<br>
You can take me to task for my ways.<br>
You can take this state for granted<br>
but this Texan’s still amazed.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

When I die, you can help me<br>
make sure I stay at home.<br>
Give my ashes to the west wind<br>
blowing down that Texas road.<br>

I'll never leave Texas... oh no, no.<br>
My mind loves the state it’s in--<br>
lone star free to roam.<br>
Fort Worth to Alamo,<br>
Beaumont to San Antone,<br>
call me loco but I know what I know,<br>
I'll never leave Texas!<br>

That New Guy<br>
By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse<br>

That new guy blows in out of nowhere,<br>
in an old red Dodge -- heck, it's older than him.<br>
He's lookin' for honest work, headin' for Houston.<br>
Comin' through here had to be on a whim.<br>
He charms every waitress, between his odd jobs.<br>
Some, they try to be his Yellow Rose.<br>
But soon, folks are talkin'. Where'd he come from? Who's he seeing?<br>
And whose heart will bruise when he goes?<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>

That new guy never crashed his new Mustang,<br>
never lost his true love in the passenger seat.<br>
No, those scars that he's wearing are all from the Army<br>
or a demon of a mare, threw him deep in mesquite.<br>
He struggles each day to keep up his guard<br>
and his heart behind that friendly wall.<br>
He jokes and he grins, but it's hokum and it's bluster.<br>
No waitress ever knows him at all.<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>

Tonight the Dodge will take him down a dozen dusty roads.<br>
At every lonely intersection,<br>
he'll flip a coin which way to go.<br>

Once he had a Yellow Rose.<br>
Once he was a Mister Right.<br>
Now he's running from the memory.<br>
He'll be moving on tonight.<br>
Come dawn, he'll find a waitress<br>
to sell him breakfast, and then<br>
he'll be that new guy, again.<br>
