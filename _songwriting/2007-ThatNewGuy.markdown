<b>That New Guy</b>
By Dan Barnes and Brad Dunse

	That new guy blows in out of nowhere,
	in an old red Dodge -- heck, it's older than him.
	He's lookin' for honest work, headin' for Houston.
	Comin' through here had to be on a whim.
	He charms every waitress, between his odd jobs.
	Some, they try to be his Yellow Rose.
	But soon, folks are talkin'. Where'd he come from? Who's he seeing?
	And whose heart will bruise when he goes?

  Once he had a Yellow Rose.
	Once he was a Mister Right.
	Now he's running from the memory.
	He'll be moving on tonight.
	Come dawn, he'll find a waitress
	to sell him breakfast, and then
	he'll be that new guy, again.

  That new guy never crashed his new Mustang,
	never lost his true love in the passenger seat.
	No, those scars that he's wearing are all from the Army
	or a demon of a mare, threw him deep in mesquite.
	He struggles each day to keep up his guard
	and his heart behind that friendly wall.
	He jokes and he grins, but it's hokum and it's bluster.
	No waitress ever knows him at all.

  Once he had a Yellow Rose.
  Once he was a Mister Right.
  Now he's running from the memory.
  He'll be moving on tonight.
  Come dawn, he'll find a waitress
  to sell him breakfast, and then
  he'll be that new guy, again.

	Tonight the Dodge will take him down a dozen dusty roads.
	At every lonely intersection,
	he'll flip a coin which way to go.

  Once he had a Yellow Rose.
  Once he was a Mister Right.
  Now he's running from the memory.
  He'll be moving on tonight.
  Come dawn, he'll find a waitress
  to sell him breakfast, and then
  he'll be that new guy, again.
